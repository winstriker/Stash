/**
 * v0.9.36 Task 12 Step 2 — pure mapper for the lyrics sheet's view state.
 *
 * Drives the [lyricsViewStateFor] derivation that the Now Playing
 * ViewModel uses to fold (current Track, observed LyricsEntity?) into
 * the sealed [LyricsViewState] the sheet renders.
 *
 * Sentinel semantics live on the Track row itself (`lyricsFetchedAt`):
 *   - NULL  → never tried → Loading (sheet will enqueue a priority fetch)
 *   - 0L    → tried, miss → None (allow Retry)
 *   - >0L   → success     → look at the LyricsEntity contents
 *
 * The mapper takes the domain [Track] rather than [TrackEntity] so the
 * ui package doesn't have to depend on the Room entity package (every
 * other type the Now Playing screen already touches is the domain
 * model). The `lyricsFetchedAt` field mirrors the entity exactly.
