 * Pluggable resolver for lossless (or higher-quality-than-current) audio

 * lucida, doubledouble, Bandcamp purchases, Internet Archive, a watched
 * local-file inbox — implements this interface.
 *
 * The resolver chain ([LosslessSourceRegistry]) iterates registered
 * sources in user-configured priority order and returns the first match
 * meeting the user's quality threshold. The actual file fetch happens
 * downstream via the existing download pipeline; a [LosslessSource] is
 * responsible only for "given a track, find a download URL."
 *
 * Implementations MUST gate every network call behind
 * [AggregatorRateLimiter.acquire] for their [id]. The rate limiter is
 * the single load-bearing safeguard against the failure mode where Stash
 * accidentally DDoSes a community-run aggregator service and gets us all
 * banned. Conservative defaults are wired in the limiter, not here.
