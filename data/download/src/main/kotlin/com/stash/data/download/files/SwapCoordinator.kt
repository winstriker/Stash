/**
 * Runs wrong-match swap downloads on an application-lifetime scope,
 * independent of any ViewModel.
 *
 * The Failed Matches UI lets users pick a replacement YouTube video for
 * a track they've flagged as wrong. Until Phase 5, that download lived
 * on `FailedMatchesViewModel`'s `viewModelScope` — which gets cancelled
 * as soon as the user navigates away. In practice that meant a user
 * could approve a swap, hit back before the ~10-second download
 * finished, and end up with the DB pointing at a deleted file while
 * the new audio was never persisted.
 *
 * This coordinator owns its own `CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() +
 * Dispatchers.IO)` — same pattern [LocalImportCoordinator] already uses
 * for long-running imports. The swap survives screen navigation; the
 * only thing that can abort it mid-flight is process death, which is
 * rare during the few seconds between "user taps approve" and "download
 * completes."
 *
 * Flow (all fire-and-forget from the caller's POV):
 *   1. Delete the old on-disk file. Failure logged and swallowed — a
 *      stray leftover file is strictly better than a lost swap, and the
 *      orphan cleanup pass eventually catches it.
 *   2. Download the new videoId via [DownloadExecutor] using the user's
 *      active quality tier.
 *   3. Commit the downloaded file through [FileOrganizer] so it lands
 *      in the canonical artist/album path (same path derivation as a
 *      normal sync download).
 *   4. Update `tracks.youtube_id` + mark downloaded, so the row
 *      reflects the new identity and disappears from Failed Matches.
 *
 * Errors at any step are logged at WARN and don't propagate — the user
 * already got optimistic feedback in the VM, and the track's flag has
 * already been cleared there. If the download truly fails, the user
 * can re-flag and try again.
