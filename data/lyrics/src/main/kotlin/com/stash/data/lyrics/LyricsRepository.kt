/**
 * Sole entrypoint for the lyrics subsystem. Both UI (Now Playing sheet)
 * and workers (post-download + backfill) go through this class.
 *
 * `resolveAndStore` walks the [sources] chain in priority order
 * (LRCLIB -> InnerTube; ordering enforced in `LyricsModule.provideLyricsSources`),
 * persists the first non-null result to the `lyrics` table, stamps
 * `tracks.lyrics_fetched_at` with the success epoch-millis, and
 * triggers a sidecar `.lrc` write for the non-instrumental case.
 *
 * Sentinel rules (see `LyricsDao` docs):
 * - Successful fetch -> upsert lyrics row + stamp `lyrics_fetched_at = clock.now()`.
 * - Complete miss across all sources -> no row + stamp `lyrics_fetched_at = 0L`.
 *   The 0L sentinel keeps the backfill worker's `WHERE lyrics_fetched_at IS NULL`
 *   predicate honest so it terminates.
 *
 * Sidecar-write failure is logged but does NOT unwind the Room state.
 * The Room row + stamp are the source of truth; the sidecar is a best-effort
 * courtesy for external players.
