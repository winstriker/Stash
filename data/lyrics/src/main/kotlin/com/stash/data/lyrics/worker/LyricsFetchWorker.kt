/**
 * Per-track lyrics fetch — runs in two enqueue contexts:
 *
 *  - **Post-download** (from `LyricsFetchTrigger` after a successful download;
 *    wired in Task 10). Unique work name `lyrics_post_download_<trackId>`,
 *    `ExistingWorkPolicy.KEEP`, network constraint, non-expedited.
 *  - **Priority on-open** (from the Now Playing lyrics sheet when a NULL-
 *    stamped track is opened; wired in Task 12). Unique work name
 *    `lyrics_priority_<trackId>`, `ExistingWorkPolicy.REPLACE`, expedited
 *    via `setExpedited(RUN_AS_NON_EXPEDITED_WORK_REQUEST)`.
 *
 * The worker is a thin coroutine wrapper over
 * [LyricsRepository.resolveAndStore]; all source orchestration, sentinel
 * stamping, and sidecar writing happens in the repository (see Task 6/7).
 *
 * **Result contract:**
 *  - Missing/invalid `KEY_TRACK_ID` (enqueuer bug) -> [Result.failure].
 *  - Track deleted between enqueue + run -> [Result.success] no-op.
 *  - `resolveAndStore` returns (hit OR confirmed miss with 0L sentinel) ->
 *    [Result.success].
 *  - `resolveAndStore` throws + `runAttemptCount < MAX_ATTEMPTS` ->
 *    [Result.retry] (WorkManager applies its own backoff).
 *  - `resolveAndStore` throws + `runAttemptCount >= MAX_ATTEMPTS` ->
 *    [Result.success] leaving `tracks.lyrics_fetched_at = NULL`. We do
 *    NOT return [Result.failure] here — the row stays NULL on purpose
 *    so the once-per-version `LyricsBackfillWorker` (Task 9) re-picks it
 *    up after the next binary bump. Returning `success` matches the
 *    actual on-disk state more honestly (we did not write a 0L sentinel
 *    — that's the repository's job on a *confirmed* miss).
