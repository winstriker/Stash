/**
 * v0.9.13: Manages the local "Liked Songs" playlist (one per install,
 * [PlaylistType.STASH_LIKED]). Lazy-seeded on the first heart-tap so a
 * fresh install carries no orphan playlist row until the user actually
 * uses the feature.
 *
 * Mirrors [com.stash.core.data.repository.MusicRepositoryImpl.linkTrackToDownloadsMix]
 * exactly — uses [MusicRepository.addTrackToPlaylist] so the playlist's
 * cached `track_count` and the cross-ref's `position` stay consistent
 * with the rest of the codebase. Raw [PlaylistDao.insertCrossRef] calls
 * skip both, so we go through the helper.
 *
 * Idempotent: tapping the heart twice on the same track is a no-op
 * after the first call (cross-ref existence check + early return), and
 * the `tracks.stash_liked_at` timestamp is only written once.
