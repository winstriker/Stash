/**
 * Periodic background worker that drains `tracks.loudness_measured_at IS NULL`
 * rows in batches of [BATCH_SIZE], invoking [LoudnessMeasurer] to compute
 * integrated LUFS + true-peak via ffmpeg's `ebur128` filter and writing the
 * results back through [TrackDao.updateLoudness] / [TrackDao.markLoudnessFailed].
 *
 * ## Scheduling
 *
 * Runs every 6 hours under WorkManager's standard constraint suite — charging
 * + idle + battery-not-low. Measuring 20 lossless tracks burns ~30s of CPU
 * and decodes hundreds of MB of audio; we are emphatically not running this
 * while the user is on battery or actively using the device. The 6-hour
 * cadence is a compromise: long enough that even a million-track library
 * drains in a few weeks of overnight charging sessions, short enough that
 * a freshly-imported batch on a Sunday afternoon doesn't sit unmeasured
 * until Wednesday.
 *
 * ## Batching strategy
 *
 * Each invocation processes up to [BATCH_SIZE] rows and exits — we
 * deliberately don't loop until the queue is empty because:
 *  1. WorkManager has a 10-minute soft cap on a single worker run, and
 *     measuring lossless audio can run 1-2s per track on cold cache.
 *  2. Bounded batches give the OS a chance to reclaim ffmpeg memory
 *     between runs (the bridge spawns a fresh native process each call,
 *     but the JNI surface area is large enough that long-running batches
 *     leak Dalvik refs in the wild).
 *  3. The periodic schedule means we'll be back in 6 hours anyway. There
 *     is no scenario where draining a 10,000-track library in one shot
 *     beats draining it across 500 idle-overnight runs.
 *
 * ## Cancellation
 *
 * `isStopped` is checked at the top of each iteration — a track caught
 * mid-measurement when WorkManager kills the worker is **not** marked
 * failed. The row stays NULL and the next run picks it up. Idempotent.
 *
 * ## Progress reporting
 *
 * After each batch, [LoudnessProgressStore.recordBatchComplete] is called
 * with the actual count processed (which may be less than the batch size
 * if cancelled mid-flight). The EqualizerScreen progress card reads from
 * the same store via a Flow, so the UI stays in sync without any extra
 * plumbing.
