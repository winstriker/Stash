/**
 * Drains pending [DiscoveryQueueEntity] rows queued by
 * [StashMixRefreshWorker]. For each one:
 *
 *  1. Check whether a track with the same canonical identity already
 *     exists (downloaded) in the library — if so, skip and just reuse
 *     the existing track row when the materializer later links the
 *     recipe's playlist.
 *  2. Otherwise create a stub [TrackEntity] with `isStreamable = true,
 *     isDownloaded = false`. v0.9.37 stream-only seam: no
 *     `download_queue` row is filed. The v0.9.30 streaming engine
 *     (`PlayerRepositoryImpl.buildMediaItemForTrack` → Qobuz/Kennyy +
 *     YouTube fallback) plays the stub on demand without ever writing
 *     a file to disk. Saves data + storage for what is, by recipe
 *     design, ephemeral discovery content. Existing downloaded Mix
 *     tracks remain on disk; no purge.
 *  3. Mark the discovery row DONE with a reference to the created (or
 *     reused) track so the next [StashMixRefreshWorker.materializeMix]
 *     pass can link it into the recipe's playlist via
 *     `PlaylistDao.getStreamableOrDoneTrackIdsForRecipe`.
 *
 * v0.9.37 also dropped the `DownloadQueueDao` constructor injection —
 * this worker no longer files download rows. The chained
 * [DiscoveryDownloadWorker] still drains legacy / leftover rows in
 * `download_queue` (orphan PENDING, retry-eligible FAILED from prior
 * runs); see `doWork()`'s tail chain.
 *
 * Caps per-recipe throughput at 100 new discoveries per rolling 7 days
 * (a hold-over from the download-era storage cap; storage cost is gone
 * now, raising the cap is tracked as separate future work). Requires
 * unmetered network + charging to be polite about data and battery.
