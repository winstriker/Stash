/**
 * Drains pending [DiscoveryQueueEntity] rows queued by
 * [StashMixRefreshWorker]. For each one:
 *
 *  1. Check whether a track with the same canonical identity already
 *     exists in the library — if so, skip the download and just link the
 *     existing track into the recipe's playlist.
 *  2. Otherwise create a stub [TrackEntity] (is_downloaded = false) and
 *     file a [DownloadQueueEntity] row. The existing
 *     [TrackDownloadWorker] picks that up and performs the actual YT
 *     search + download, reusing every bit of matching infra we already
 *     ship. No duplicate code paths.
 *  3. Link the new (or found) track into the recipe's playlist so it
 *     appears in the mix as soon as its audio is downloaded.
 *  4. Mark the discovery row DONE with a reference to the created track
 *     so diagnostics can trace the seed → candidate → download chain.
 *
 * Caps per-recipe throughput at 10 new discoveries per rolling 7 days so
 * a mix with many pending candidates doesn't blow up the user's disk
 * overnight. Requires unmetered network + charging to be polite about
 * data and battery.
