/**
 * Thin adapter around the ffmpeg binary shipped by
 * `io.github.junkfood02.youtubedl-android:ffmpeg`. Sole purpose: testability.
 *
 * The library only exposes `FFmpeg.init(context)`, which extracts the ffmpeg
 * native binary to `applicationInfo.nativeLibraryDir/libffmpeg.so` (the
 * "fake .so" trick that lets Android's loader unpack an executable as if it
 * were a shared library — same approach used by `libqjs.so` in this project).
 * There is no in-process `execute(args)` API, so we shell out via
 * `ProcessBuilder` ourselves. The youtubedl-android library does the same
 * thing internally when running yt-dlp.
 *
 * The ebur128 filter writes its Summary block to **stderr**, so the contract
 * captures stderr specifically. stdout (typically empty for `-f null -`) is
 * discarded.
 *
 * Callers MUST ensure `FFmpeg.getInstance().init(context)` has been called
 * before invoking [runWithStderrCapture] (the binary won't exist on disk
 * otherwise). In this project that happens at app start inside
 * [com.stash.data.download.ytdlp.YtDlpManager.initialize].

     * Throws [java.io.IOException] if the binary cannot be located or the

     * non-zero exit (e.g. ffmpeg's "Output #0, null" sentinel at the end of
     * an ebur128 pass still exits 0, but a malformed input might exit 1)
     * still returns whatever stderr was captured, so the parser can inspect
     * it. Inspect the returned text for the expected Summary block;
     * propagate failure from there.
