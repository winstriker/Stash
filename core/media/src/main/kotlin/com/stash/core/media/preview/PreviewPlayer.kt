/**
 * Lightweight, singleton ExoPlayer wrapper for in-app audio preview.
 *
 * ### Responsibilities
 * - Accepts a stream URL and a logical [videoId] and plays the audio.
 * - Exposes [previewState] so the UI can react to playback transitions.
 * - Configures [AudioAttributes] with [C.USAGE_MEDIA] and `handleAudioFocus = true`
 *   so that Android's audio focus system pauses the main [StashPlaybackService]
 *   player whenever a preview starts — and resumes it when the preview stops.
 *
 * ### Non-responsibilities
 * - Knows nothing about yt-dlp or URL resolution.
 * - Has no [MediaSession] or system notification.
 * - Does not manage playback queues.
 *
 * ### Lifecycle
 * The underlying [ExoPlayer] is created lazily on the first [playUrl] call to
 * avoid allocating native resources until they are needed.  Call [release] when
 * the owning component is permanently destroyed (e.g. process exit or DI graph
 * teardown) to free those resources.
