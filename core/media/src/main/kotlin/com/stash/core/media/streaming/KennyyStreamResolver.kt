/**
 * Adapts the existing lossless-download [KennyySource] into a stream-URL
 * resolver. Given a [TrackEntity], builds the same [TrackQuery] the
 * download pipeline would, invokes Kennyy's catalog search + signed-URL
 * lookup, and pulls the `etsp` query parameter out of the resulting URL
 * to compute when the signature expires.
 *
 * `etsp` is the URL signature expiry the qobuz.kennyy.com.br proxy
 * (and qobuz.squid.wtf, same Qobuz-DL codebase) bakes into every
 * download URL. Format is a Unix epoch in *seconds* — multiply by 1000
 * to align with [System.currentTimeMillis]. Past `etsp`, the Akamai CDN
 * returns 403 and the player must re-resolve.
 *
 * Returns null when:
 *  - Kennyy has no confident match for the track (downstream pipeline
 *    should fall through to YouTube, or surface "not streamable").
 *  - The returned URL has no `etsp` parameter. Defensive: a URL we can't
 *    safely refresh is one we shouldn't cache; treat it as unresolved
 *    rather than letting the player hit a non-refreshable 403 later.
 *  - The `etsp` value isn't an integer.
 *
 * v1 note: streaming quality follows the existing lossless-download
 * preference ([com.stash.data.download.lossless.LosslessSourcePreferences])
 * because [TrackQuery] has no `preferredQuality` field yet. The
 * `streamQuality` flow on [com.stash.core.media.streaming
 * .StreamingPreference] is stored but unused here until a follow-up
 * threads quality through [KennyySource.resolve].
