> **Your Spotify + YouTube Music library, downloaded and playable offline.**

Stash is an offline-first Android music player that syncs your liked songs, playlists, daily mixes, and discover mixes from both **Spotify** and **YouTube Music** into a single unified local library. Tracks are downloaded as high-quality FLAC audio with a full equalizer & queue management.

**Stash is not an online streaming service.** It's a personal-library tool for people who already have Spotify or YouTube Music accounts and want their library available offline on their terms.

---

## Features

- **Offline everything** — tracks download as high-quality lossless audio
- **Bulletproof matching** — finds the right version of tracks 99% of the time
- **Custom playlists** — create your own playlists and save tracks to them from anywhere.
- **Spotify & YT sync preferences** — choose exactly which playlists, liked songs, daily mixes, and discovery mixes to sync. Individual toggles for each. Don't want Daily Mix 3? Turn it off.
- **Expanded Spotify mix detection** — Release Radar, Discover Weekly, On Repeat, Daylist, Repeat Rewind, Time Capsule, and Daily Mixes 1-6 are all automatically detected when available. Each gets its own toggle.
- **Refresh vs Accumulate sync modes** — mixes can either replace their contents each sync (Refresh) or stack new tracks on top of what's already there (Accumulate). Your call.
- **Parallel downloads** — 8 simultaneous tracks. Background sync runs as a foreground service so it actually finishes with the phone locked.
- **High-res album art**
- **Automatic update notifications** — checks GitHub for new releases daily and notifies you when one is available.
- **Full equalizer** — 5-band EQ with presets, bass boost, and virtualizer
- **Spotify sign-in built in** — just log into Spotify inside the app
- **Private by design** — credentials encrypted with AES-256-GCM, no servers, no telemetry, nothing leaves your phone
- **Free and open source** — no subscriptions, no ads, GPL-3.0

## Requirements

- Android **8.0 (API 26)** or later
- Roughly **9-15 GB** of free storage for a medium library (scales with your library size)
- An active **Spotify account** and/or a **YouTube Music account**
- Stash is not on the Google Play Store and won't be (see [Why Not Play Store?](#why-not-play-store) below)

---

## Installation

### Option 1 — Download the APK (recommended)

1. Open **[the Releases page](https://github.com/rawnaldclark/Stash/releases)** on your Android device's browser.
2. Download the latest `Stash-v*.apk` file.
3. Open the downloaded file.
4. If Android warns you about "installing from unknown sources," tap **Settings** and allow it for your browser, then try opening the file again.
5. Tap **Install** when prompted.
6. Done — open Stash from your app drawer.

### Option 2 — Auto-update via Obtainium (advanced)

[Obtainium](https://obtainium.imranr.dev/) is a free app that tracks GitHub Releases and notifies you when a new version is out. If you don't want to manually re-download APKs each release:

1. Install Obtainium.
2. Tap **Add App** and paste `https://github.com/rawnaldclark/Stash`.
3. Obtainium will now prompt you to update whenever a new Stash release ships.

### Option 3 — Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rawnaldclark/Stash.git
cd Stash
./gradlew assembleDebug
# APK lands in app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
```

You'll need **Android Studio** (Hedgehog / 2023.1.1 or later), **JDK 17**, and **Android SDK 35**. Open the project in Android Studio, let Gradle sync, then Run.

## First-Time Setup

Stash doesn't use Spotify's or YouTube's official APIs (they don't offer what Stash needs). Instead, it uses your login cookies. This sounds scary but takes about two minutes per service. Your cookies live **only on your phone**, encrypted with AES-256-GCM, and are sent **only to Spotify and YouTube themselves** — never to a Stash server (there isn't one).

<details>
<summary><b>🎵 Connect Spotify (click to expand)</b></summary>

### What you need
- A computer or another device with a desktop browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
- Spotify account logged in on that browser

### Option A — Sign in via the app (easiest)

1. Open Stash → **Settings** → tap **Spotify** under Accounts → tap **Connect**.
2. A Spotify login page will appear inside the app.
3. Sign in with your email/password, Google, Apple, or Facebook — whatever you normally use.
4. Once login succeeds, Stash extracts the cookie automatically. Done.

If the in-app login doesn't work for you, use Option B below.

### Option B — Paste the cookie manually

1. On your computer, open **[https://open.spotify.com](https://open.spotify.com)** and make sure you're logged in.
2. Press **F12** on your keyboard to open Developer Tools. A panel will open on the right or bottom of your browser.
3. Find the **Application** tab at the top of the DevTools panel (on Firefox it's called **Storage**). If you don't see it, click the `>>` arrows to find it.
4. In the left sidebar of that tab, expand **Cookies** → click **`https://open.spotify.com`**.
5. You'll see a list of cookies. Find the one named **`sp_dc`**.
6. Double-click the value next to `sp_dc` and copy it (Ctrl+C / Cmd+C). It's a long string of random characters.
7. Open Stash on your phone → **Settings** → tap **Spotify** → tap **Connect** → tap **"Paste cookie"** in the top-right corner.
8. Paste the `sp_dc` cookie into the dialog and tap **Connect**.

> **Tip:** Some users have reported that cookies from incognito/private browsing windows can fail to sync. If you run into issues, try using your regular (non-incognito) browser window instead.

> **Why a cookie and not a password?** Spotify's mobile login API doesn't allow third-party apps. The cookie approach lets Stash authenticate as your browser session does. The cookie is session-scoped and can be revoked by logging out of Spotify on the web.

<summary><b>📺 Connect YouTube Music (click to expand)</b></summary>

### What you need
- A computer or another device with a desktop browser
- Your YouTube Music account logged in on that browser

### Steps

1. On your computer, open **[https://music.youtube.com](https://music.youtube.com)** and make sure you're logged in.
2. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools.
3. Click the **Network** tab at the top of DevTools.
4. Refresh the YouTube Music page (F5 / Cmd+R).
5. In the Network tab's filter/search box, type **`browse`** and press Enter.
6. Click any of the requests in the list (they should all start with `browse`).
7. Scroll down in the right panel until you find **Request Headers**.
8. Find the line starting with **`cookie:`** and copy the *entire* value after `cookie:` — it will be a very long string with many `=` and `;` characters.
9. Open Stash on your phone → **Settings** → tap **YouTube Music** under Accounts → tap **Connect**.
10. Paste the full cookie string and tap **Connect**.

Stash will start fetching your YouTube Music daily mixes, discover mix, replay mix, and liked music.

> **Tip:** Some users have reported that cookies from incognito/private browsing windows can fail to sync. If you run into issues, try using your regular (non-incognito) browser window instead.

> **Why the whole cookie header?** YouTube uses multiple cookies together to authenticate (`SAPISID`, `__Secure-3PAPISID`, and `LOGIN_INFO`). Grabbing all of them at once is easier than finding each individually.

### After setup

Once you've connected a service, head to the **Sync** tab. Before you hit Sync Now, expand the **Spotify Sync Preferences** card to pick exactly what you want — liked songs, specific playlists, daily mixes, discovery mixes like Release Radar and Discover Weekly, or all of the above. Each one gets its own toggle. Uncheck anything you don't care about and it won't waste your time or storage.

For mix playlists, you can also choose between **Refresh** mode (replaces the mix contents each sync, cleaning up old tracks) and **Accumulate** mode (stacks new tracks on top of what's already there). Refresh is the default and works well for most people.

The first sync takes a while depending on how much you're pulling (a library of 1000+ songs might take an hour or so — downloads run 8 at a time now, so it's faster than it used to be). After that, daily syncs just grab whatever's new. You can set it to run automatically on a schedule so your library stays current without you thinking about it.

### Troubleshooting: Sync stops or fails in the background

Some Android devices kill background processes aggressively to save battery. If your sync fails with a foreground service error or just stops partway through, you need to let Stash run unrestricted:

1. Go to your phone's **Settings** → **Apps** → **Stash**
2. Tap **Battery** (or "App battery usage")
3. Select **Unrestricted**

This tells Android to let Stash keep running in the background while it downloads your library. Without this, some phones will kill the sync after a few minutes. You only need to do this once.

> **Note for Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus, and Huawei users:** These manufacturers have extra battery restrictions on top of stock Android. If setting Unrestricted doesn't help, check [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com/) for device-specific instructions.

## Why Not the Play Store?

Stash downloads audio from YouTube and Spotify, which violates both services' Terms of Service. Google Play policy bans apps that facilitate unauthorized downloads. Every app in this space — **NewPipe, YTDLnis, SpotTube, InnerTune** — is distributed outside the Play Store for the same reason.

That's not a bug, it's a principled stance: open-source tools that give users control over their own libraries don't belong in a gatekept store that could revoke them on a whim. Distribution via GitHub Releases and **F-Droid** (once we're ready) is the right home for Stash.

- **No analytics**, no telemetry, no crash reporting to third parties.
- **Cookies are encrypted** at rest with AES-256-GCM via Google's [Tink](https://developers.google.com/tink) library.
- **No Stash servers** exist. There's no account, no backend, no "cloud sync" of anything.
- **All code is open source** and auditable — see the repo.
